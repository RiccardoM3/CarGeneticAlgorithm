# CarGeneticAlgorithm
Unity Project where cars learn to drive using a genetic machine learning algorithm.  
- Cars are initialised with random neural networks
- Every generation, mutations to the networks occur randomly
- Cars with higher performance are then more likely to reproduce for the next generation
